# The-Choate-Robotics-Guide-to-VEX-EDR-Competition-Robotics

##Reading/Printing

If you would like to read or print the guide, it is recommended that you download the PDF version (potentially compressed) of the most recent revision (REV - is the release, REV A is the first revision, etc.). You uncompress the file as you would any other zip.

##Editing

If you would like to edit the guide (we welcome this!) Please download a version of the Word document, and edit that locally. TURN ON TRACK CHANGES, and begin editing. In the revision table at the beginning, name what revision you have created (A = 1st, B = 2nd, C = 3rd, etc.), and document what changes you have made in the document. Upload this track changes word documnent (compressed), titled like the first was but with your revision letter. Then, save the file as a PDF (without the track changes visible) and upload the PDF version as well (for reading and printing).
